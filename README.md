## Activity
Activity 1: Classes and Encapsulation.
- complete the LibraryItem class and LibrarayUser class according to  class diagram and code the __init__ to initialize the class attributes.
- set all the class attributes as private, and define the accessors as shown on the class diagram. creat setter decorate when it is needed.
Activity 2: Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism.
- The BorrowerStatus class is indeed inheriting from Enum. When creating the BorrowerStatus class as an enumeration by inheriting from Enum, we are using inheritance to define a set of named constants that belong to a distinct type. By inheriting from Enum, BorrowerStatus becomes a subclass of the Enum class. This means that BorrowerStatus has all the properties and methods of the Enum class, along with the additional named values (ACTIVE, DELINQUENT, etc.)
Activity 3: Design Patterns.

Activity 4: Programming Paradigms.
- Programming Paradigms provide a framework for creating a programmer structures and organizing the code. 
- it is clear and concise
Activity 5: Help Files and Installers.
- Help Files provided with a software application help me in understanding how to use the software. and we can search for explaination of some orinal methods and classes, and learn to how to use them.
